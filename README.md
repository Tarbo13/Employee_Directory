## Description
This application was created using React.js.  Using “Random User API” I generated an employee directory that can be sorted by first name.  This application is broken up into several components that use state to generate the UI.  React functions `useEffect` and `useState` are used to update the page based on user inputs.  My page will update in real time as an employee's name is entered into the user input.  “State” is tracked by React to create this effect. 

## Installation
This app requires the following dependencies to be installed, `react`, & `react-dom`.  Once built the page is deployed on GitHub Pages.  

## Usage
This app generates a random list of employees from an API that can then be sorted by name based on a user's input.  Also, employees can be sorted by first name by selecting the “first name” button in the table header.
